/*
  Computing the square root of an integer or a fixed point integer into a
  fixed point integer. A fixed point is a 32 bit value with the comma between
  the bits 15 and 16, where bit 0 is the less significant bit of the value.
  The algorithms can be easily extended to 64bit integers, or different
  fixed point comma positions.
  The algorithm uses the property that computing x² is trivial compared to the
  sqrt. It will thus search the biggest x so that x² <= v, assuming we compute
  sqrt(v).
  The algorithm tests each bit of x starting with the most significant toward
  the less significant. It tests if the bit must be set or not.
  The algorithm uses the relation (x + a)² = x² + 2ax + a² to add the bit
  efficiently. Instead of computing x² it keeps track of (x + a)² - x².
  When computing sqrt(v), r = v - x², q = 2ax, b = a² and t = 2ax + a2.
  Note that the input integers are signed and that the sign bit is used in
  the computation. To accept unsigned integer as input, unfolding the initial
  loop is required to handle this particular case. See the usenet discussion
  for the proposed solution.

        this implementation.
