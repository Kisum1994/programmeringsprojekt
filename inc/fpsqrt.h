/*
  Computing the square root of an integer or a fixed point into a
  fixed point integer. A fixed point is a 32 bit value with the comma between
  the bits 15 and 16, where bit 0 is the less significant bit of the value.

  The algorithms can be easily extended to 64bit integers, or different
  fixed point comma positions.
